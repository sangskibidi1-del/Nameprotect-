-- Professional Roblox Lua Script: Self-Kick with Custom Message
-- Author: Experienced Roblox Developer
-- Description: This script is designed to kick the local player from the game with a specified message.
-- Note: Player:Kick() must be called from the server-side to function properly. If executed as a LocalScript,
--       it will not work due to Roblox's security restrictions. For testing, use a ServerScript in ServerScriptService
--       or leverage RemoteEvents to trigger a server-side kick. This example assumes server-side execution for a specific player.
--       In a real scenario, adapt it to your game's architecture, ensuring proper permissions and anti-exploit measures.

-- Import necessary services
local Players = game:GetService("Players")

-- Function to kick a player with a custom message
local function kickPlayer(player, message)
    if player and player:IsA("Player") then
        -- Perform the kick operation
        player:Kick(message or "You have been kicked from the game.")
        print("Player " .. player.Name .. " has been kicked with message: " .. message)
    else
        warn("Invalid player object provided for kick operation.")
    end
end

-- Example usage: Kick the local player (adapt for server context)
-- In a ServerScript, you might identify the player via events or other means.
-- For demonstration, assuming we have a target player (e.g., the first player in the game).
local targetPlayer = Players:GetPlayers()[1]  -- Replace with actual player reference, e.g., Players.LocalPlayer (but note client limitations)
local kickMessage = "i gave up"  -- Custom kick message as requested

-- Execute the kick
kickPlayer(targetPlayer, kickMessage)

-- Additional professional practices:
-- - Error handling: Wrap in pcall for robustness in production.
-- - Logging: Integrate with a logging system for audit trails.
-- - Security: Ensure this is only callable by authorized users/admins to prevent abuse.
-- - Best Practices: Comment your code, use meaningful variable names, and modularize functions for reusability.
